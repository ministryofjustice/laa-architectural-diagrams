## High-level diagrams

**Intended audience**: Everyone (technical and non-technical).

These diagrams aim to inform about the _users_ and _integrations_ around the system in focus. The drawings are intended
to support these questions:

- Who uses the system (humans, internal or external)
- What is the use-case for the system, what problem does it solve
- What integrations exist with other systems
